<h2>Introduction</h2>

VertexDB is a high performance (20,000+ requests per second) graph database server that supports automatic garbage collection. It uses the HTTP protocol for requests and JSON for it's response data format. 
<p>

It's API is inspired by the FUSE filesystem API (with an extra 'select' API for queries) and was designed with the intention of offering a FUSE interface in the future.

<br>
<br>

<h2>Data Integrity</h2>

On startup, VertexDB makes a backup of the database (if it exists). When shut down properly, it creates a file that marks the database as being safely. When started, if this file is not found, the database file is replaced by it's old copy.
<p>
VDB caches all writes until a given number of bytes worth of writes is accumulated, then it transactionally writes all queued writes to disk.

<br>
<br>

<h2>Security</h2>

The current way to secure the server is by running it on an isolated network. HTTP auth support will be added in the future.

<br>
<br>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

It's implemented in C and is currently based on the TokyoCabinet, libevent and Yajl libraries. VertexDB uses a single OS thread and handles all requests serially, but uses async sockets so no request is blocked on socket i/o though it can still block on disk i/o. 
<p>
Requests should be generally designed such that responses don't spend too much time blocking on disk i/o or using too much memory in queued response buffers. Generally, this shouldn't be a problem.
