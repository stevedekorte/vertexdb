<h1>The Vertex Database</h1> 
<br>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<ul>

VertexDB is a high performance (20,000+ requests per second) graph database server that supports automatic garbage collection. It uses the HTTP protocol for requests and JSON for it's response data format. 
<p>

It's API is inspired by the FUSE filesystem API (with a few extra APIs for queries and queues) and was designed with the intention of offering a FUSE interface in the future.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Integrity</h2>

On startup, VertexDB makes a backup of the database (if it exists). When shut down properly, it creates a file that marks the database as being safely. When started, if this file is not found, the database file is replaced by it's old copy.
<p>
VDB caches all writes until a given number of bytes worth of writes is accumulated, then it transactionally writes all queued writes to disk.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Security</h2>

The current way to secure the server is by running it on an isolated network. HTTP auth support will be added in the future.
<br>
<br>


<h2>Applications</h2>

Graph databases aren't ideal for all uses, but can be more suitable than other models for dealing with changing or informal schemas and data that is more naturally represented as a graph. It's atomic queue APIs can also make vertexdb useful as a high performance persistent queueing server.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

The current implementation is in C and built on top of the TokyoCabinet (a b-tree key/value disk store), libevent (asynchronous sockets and HTTP) and Yajl(JSON parsing/generation) libraries. VertexDB uses a single OS thread and handles all requests serially, but uses async sockets so no request is blocked on socket i/o (though it can still block on disk i/o). 
<p>
Requests should be generally designed such that responses don't spend too much time blocking on disk i/o or using too much memory in queued response buffers. This can be done by "paging" requests by limiting their results count and repeatedly using a query that selects the next set of matches.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Future</h2>

Possible future features:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> FUSE interface
	<li> distributed redundant servers
	<li> automatic index creation
	<li> a NodeJS implementation which uses JS for queries?
</ul>
<br>
<br>

</ul>



<h1>Basics</h1>

<ul>
<h2>Requests</h2>
<ul>
The HTTP protocol is used for requests. The path part of the query specifies a path in the database's graph of nodes and the query parameters are used to specify actions on that path (read, write, search, etc). 
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Responses</h2>
<ul>
Responses are sent in JSON format in the HTTP content. On error, a HTTP response status of 500 is sent with the HTTP content containing the error message in JSON format. 
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Keys and Values</h2>
<ul>
	
Node keys that hold string values......
</ul>
<br>

<h2>URLs</h2>
<ul>
For brevity, the "http://host:port" parts of the request URLs fields are left out and the word "path" is used to mean any forward slash delimited path. 
</ul>
<br>

</ul>
<br>


<h1>Node Operations</h1>

</pre>
</ul>
<br>

<p class=api1>rm</p>
<ul>

<pre>
sample request: /path?action=rm
sample response: null
</pre>
</ul>
<br>

<p class=api1>size</p>
<ul>
	Returns the number of slots at the node in the specified path. Returns an error if the path doesn't exist.
<pre>

sample response: 423
</pre>
</ul>
<br>

<p class=api1>link</p>
<ul>

<pre>
sample request: /sourcePath/?action=link&key=k&toPath=destinationPath
sample response: 423
</pre>
</ul>
<br>

</ul>
<br>

<h1>Value Operations</h1>

<ul>
<p class=api1>read</p>
<ul>
	Read a value at a given path. Returns the value on success.	
<pre>

sample response: "foo"
</pre>
</ul>
<br>

<p class=api1>write</p> 
<ul>
	Sets or appends a value at a specified path. Returns null on success.
<p class=api2>set</p>
<pre>
sample request: /path?key=k&action=write&mode=set
with post: foo

<h1>Queue Operations</h1>

<ul>

<p class=api1>queuePopTo</p>

Returns the key that the node was under. The ttl attribute is a time-to-live value as a number of seconds. 
When the server pops the node to the new location, it computes the expiration date and creates a _qexpire and _qtime slots on the node which are used by the server when queueExpireTo requests are sent. Note: Expirations on a node are only performed when the queueExpireTo request is sent to it.

<pre>
sample request: /sourcePath/?action=queueExpireTo&toPath=/destinationPath
sample response: 42
