About

Vertex is a high performance graph database that supports automatic garbage collection, built on libevent and tokyocabinet. It uses HTTP as it's communication protocol and JSON as it's response data format. It's BSD licensed and was written by Steve Dekorte and Rich Collins.

Status

Currently only ready for tinkering. Still need to finish adding tests and permissions support and docs before it's ready for production use. See docs/guide.html for API and other details.

Future

FUSE interface and may add support for more complex queries and dynamic/ automatic index creation based on observed queries.
