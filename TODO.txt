	- transactions
	- collect garbage
	- backup
	- shutdown
	- queuePopTo ttl
	- chmod
	- chown
	- stat
	- stats
	- login?
	- newuser? (lowest priority)

- make sure docs are in sync with code

- add performance tests for:
	- writes, removes, reads per second
	- db size per number of writes
	- possibly look into tokyocabinet tuning parameters

- FUSE interface

- start project to reimplement vertexdb in Lua or Javascript v8 with async sockets & tokyocabinet - this would allow us to use Lua or JS as a query language
